##*The Call to Worship: Psalm 108:3-5  
All: I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples;  
I will sing praises to you among the nations.  
For your steadfast love is great above the heavens;  
 your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.  
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!  
 Let your glory be over all the earth!  
---
*Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah  
Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah, pilgrim through this barren land;  
I am weak, but Thou art mighty; hold me with Thy pow'rful hand;  
Bread of heaven, bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more,  
Feed me till I want no more.  
Open now the crystal fountain, whence the healing stream doth flow;  
Let the fire and cloudy pillar lead me all my journey through;  
Strong Deliverer, strong Deliverer, be Thou still my strength and shield,  
Be Thou still my strength and shield.  
When I tread the verge of Jordan, bid my anxious fears subside;  
Death of death, and hell’s destruction, land me safe on Canaan's side;  
Songs of praises, songs of praises I will ever give to Thee,  
I will ever give to Thee.

## The Prayers of Confession  
All: Gracious and holy Father,  
 we confess that our hearts are consumed  
 with the fears and cares of this world.  
The deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things  
 choke out Your Word and grieve Your Spirit in our lives.  
Forgive us for being led astray  
 from a single-minded, pure, and undistracted devotion to You,  
 our faithful Father, our loving Savior and life-giving Spirit.  
Pardon us for doubting your promises and questioning your goodness.  
Send your Spirit to rekindle the fires of devotion in our hearts.  
For we pray in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord and King. Amen.  
PRIVATE (Silence is kept for private confession)

## The Assurance of Forgiveness  
Leader: The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus  
came into the world to save sinners. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree,  
that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been  
healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and  
Overseer of your souls. (1 Timothy 1:15; 1 Peter 2:24)  
All: Thanks be to God who forgives our sins through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

*Stronger  
There is love that came for us, humbled to a sinner's cross  
You broke my shame and sinfulness, You rose again victorious  
Faithfulness none can deny, through the storm and through the fire  
There is truth that sets me free, Jesus Christ who lives in me  
(chorus)  
You are stronger, You are stronger  
Sin is broken, You have saved me  
It is written, Christ is risen  
Jesus You are Lord of all  
No beginning and no end, You’re my hope and my defense  
You came to seek and save the lost, You paid it all upon the cross  
(repeat chorus)  
So let Your Name be lifted higher  
Be lifted higher, be lifted higher (2x)  
(repeat chorus 2x)  
Jesus You are Lord of all (2x)

##*The Profession of Faith: Ephesians. 2:1-10  
All: And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following  
the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is  
now at work in the sons of disobedience—among whom we all once lived in the passions  
of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by  
nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being rich in mercy, because  
of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our  
trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— and  
raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so  
that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness  
toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this  
is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may  
boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God  
prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.
